# [GAME TITLE TBD] - README
Welcome to this text-based RPG game project in C#! In this game, your goal is to reach the 30th floor of a tower filled with challenges and dangers. Along the way, you will face boss monsters on every 10th floor, each more powerful than the last.

The game features an experience point system that allows you to level up your character as you progress through the tower. Each level-up will upgrade your character's stats and unlock various spells and abilities. You'll need to carefully choose how you distribute your points to make sure you're prepared for the challenges ahead.

In a later update, we'll introduce a smithing feature that will allow players to create and upgrade their own equipment. With this feature, you'll be able to craft weapons and armor to suit your playstyle and make your character even more powerful.

> "This is the best text-based game of 2023!" - Some person, somewhere, probably.


## Installation
To run the game, you'll need to have .NET Core 3.1 or later installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of .NET Core from the official website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Once you've installed .NET Core, clone or download the repository to your machine and open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE. Build the solution and run the program to start playing the game.

## How to Play
The game is controlled entirely through text commands. 
Your character's statistics are shown below:

- Health Points (HP): A measure of your life. If it reaches zero, you die.
- Focus Points (FP): A measure of your focus. Used for casting spells and performing abilities.
- Physical Attack (PATK): A measure of your physical strength. Increases damage of physical abilities.
- Physical Defense (PDEF): A measure of your physical defense. Decreases physical damage taken.
- Magic Attack (MATK): A measure of your magic strength. Increases damage of magical abilities.
- Magic Defense (MDEF): A measure of your magic defense. Decreases magical damage taken.
- Speed (SPD): A measure of your speed. Allows you to move first more often and avoid being ambushed as frequently.
- Luck (LUC): A measure of your luck. Affects many things.

When prompted, type the number or letter corresponding to your chosen action to proceed. The available actions will vary depending on your current location and situation.

As you progress through the game, you'll encounter enemies that you'll need to defeat in turn-based combat. During combat, you can choose to attack, use items, or try to flee. Your success in combat will depend on your character's stats and equipment.

The tower is home to many creatures, and traps are common. Many random encounters will frequent your path as you progress. Use your wits and overcome these challenges, and conquer the top floor!
